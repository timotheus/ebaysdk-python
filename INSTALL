Testing the SDK:
~/> export EBAY_YAML='myebay.yaml'; python setup.py test

Installing ebaysdk on Windows:


1) Download and install the latest release of Python 2.7: 

http://python.org/download/

Choose either "Python 3.3.0 Windows x86 MSI Installer" or "Python
3.3.0 Windows X86-64 MSI Installer". To use the latter, you must be
running a 64-bit version of Windows. 

2) Install setuptools:

First, visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

If you chose the 32-bit version of Python in step 1, you can simply
use latest setuptools package for "MS Windows installer" for Python
2.7 (example setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe). In this case, simply
download the file and run it to install setuptools.

If you chose the X86-64 version in step 1, you must download
ez_setup.py from the setuptools page to download and install
setuptools, then run it from the command prompt as follows:
  
  a. Open the Command Prompt
  b. Change to the directory in which ez_setup.py was downloaded
  c. Install setuptools as follows: c:\Python27\python.exe ez_setup.py

The last step assumes that Python was installed to its default
location.

3) Install pycurl:

This could be complicated because pycurl requires libcurl to be
installed. Since this is a native library, this can't be installed
using pip or easy_install. Luckily Christoph Gohlke has pre-complied
many common libraries for Python on Windows, including 32- and 64-bit
versions.

Simply visit this site:
 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Then download and install the appropriate version of pycurl for Python
2.7. Use the amd64 version if you are running 64-bit
Python. Otherwise, use the win32 version.

4) Install ebaysdk:

Download and extract the zipball, or clone the ebaysdk-python
repository. Then open the Command Prompt and change to the root
directory of the distribution and execute:
  
  c:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install

If there were no errors, ebaysdk should be ready to use!
